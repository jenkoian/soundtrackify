Soundtrackify
==============

Basic sample spotify app. It does the following:

- Grabs latest box office movies from the Rotten Tomatoes API based on users country
- Searches spotify for an album with the name of the movie in the title
- Displays the albums to the user as the latest soundtracks

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any way of obtaining accurate soundtrack data for a movie, so soundtracks are
limited to best guess results from the spotify search.
